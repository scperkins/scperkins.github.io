title: Building This Site (Part 1)

h3. {{ page.title }}

So as I mentioned before, I've pretty much been learning how to use GithUb pages and Jekyll
as I go. Today I did spend a lot of time trying to just *make things work*. It's not that complicated, but when you're learning something new it can be frustrating; one moment everything 
looks great and another it's broken (thank science for git, seriously). Although it doesn't look like I have a lot to show for it, I think a lot of the hard work is done and I have a pretty good
idea about how I'll put together the rest of the site. From there it will just be a matter of refactoring and adding or subtracting things as I see fit. The next big things for this site are:

* Comments section for the blog
* Getting the Resume page to render my resume, which is written in LaTeX.
* ???
* Profit!
