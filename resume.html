				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p>I'm one of those people whose interests are far-ranging, and as soon I see something that interests me,
					I start to to dabble and experiment with it, as I wonder about the possible things I could create with it.
					This includes anything from web servers and static site generators to low-level programs written in C or Haskell. In addition to fiddling with front-end design, I love customizing my desktop environment with custom window managers and scripts. Let's not leave out all the hardware stuff like brain-computer interfaces, Arduinos, quadro-copters and Raspberry Pi's!</p>

				<h3>Education</h3>
