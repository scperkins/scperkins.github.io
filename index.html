        <h4>Hi there! You've found my web page dedicated as a hub for my programming projects, ideas, resume and general musings.</h4>
        <p class='body'>I'm a graduate of the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu">University of Vermont</a>  with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in German. The purpose of this site is to showcase my capabilities, ideas and growth within computer science and software development through coding/programming projects and exercises. As you'll probably notice from skimming this site, I'm partial to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> and open source software, such as  <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, but really, I'm open to whatever tools I think are interesting and/or worth learning.</p>
